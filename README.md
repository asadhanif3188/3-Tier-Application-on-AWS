# 3-Tier Application Deployment on AWS

This repository contains my reimplementation of the 3-tier application originally presented in the Medium article "A Resilient AWS Three-Tier Architecture Design and Deployment Project: https://medium.com/@cloudoers/aws-three-tier-architecture-design-and-deployment-5abdaae2e601" by Kwasi Twum-Ampofo (KTA). The goal of this project is to showcase the practical application of the concepts discussed in the article and provide a comprehensive guide for developers interested in understanding and implementing a 3-tier architecture.

## Key Features:
- Web Tier: [Brief description of the front-end technologies and frameworks used]
- App Tier: [Brief description of the back-end technologies and frameworks used]
- Data Tier: [Brief description of the database and storage solutions employed]
- Distribution of resources in VPC and subnets
- Multi-tier deployment
- Auto-scaling   

<!-- - Dockerized Deployment: The entire application is containerized using Docker, ensuring easy deployment and scalability. -->

## Goal of Reimplementation:
- The goal of this project is to showcase the practical application of the concepts discussed in the article and provide a comprehensive guide for developers interested in understanding and implementing a 3-tier architecture.
- Motivation behind this reimplemention is to demonstrate the skill set to the potential client.
